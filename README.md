## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

After enjoying mods and not seeing certain mods in the games I've played, I decided to try modding myself.
This would expose me to various coding languages and drive me to code specialized tools to help improve modder's workflows including myself.

With the mindset of creating user-friendly UIs, the pivot to software development feels like the next course of action as that field has sections centered around UI/UX.
Hopefully, the projects and tools I've created can help me get the role I wanted!
